The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. Developed in the early 1970s by IBM and later adopted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), DES was a cornerstone of secure communication for decades. It operates on 64-bit blocks of data using a 56-bit key, with an additional 8 bits for parity checking, making the total key length 64 bits. The algorithm consists of 16 rounds of processing, each involving permutation, substitution, and key mixing operations to transform plaintext into ciphertext.

DES begins with an initial permutation (IP) that rearranges the 64 bits of the input block. The permuted block is then split into two 32-bit halves, referred to as the left and right halves. Each round applies a series of transformations, including expansion (where the right half is expanded to 48 bits), key mixing (where a 48-bit subkey is XORed with the expanded right half), substitution (via eight S-boxes that map 6-bit inputs to 4-bit outputs), and permutation (rearranging the resulting bits). The subkeys are derived from the main key through a key schedule process, which involves permuting and shifting the key bits to generate 16 unique 48-bit subkeys. After the 16 rounds, the left and right halves are swapped, and a final permutation (the inverse of the initial permutation) is applied to produce the ciphertext.

Despite its historical significance, DES is no longer considered secure for modern applications due to its relatively short key length, which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. By the late 1990s, advances in computing power demonstrated that DES could be cracked i
